This repository contains 3 projects: Kalman filter (Embbeded & Matlab) and Madgwick AHRS (Embbeded).

Kalman filter: You can find programs for simulations with real and no real data (Matlab). The real data is obtained from a MPU9250(IMU) and uBlox-Neo6m (GPS). You can also find an embbeded application for FRDMK64 (Still Working).

Madgwick AHRS: An embbeded application to get Roll-Pitch-Yaw using Madgwick algorithm, implemented using a FRDMK64 and AGM01 (IMU 9DOF/FXOS8700/FXAS21002C).
