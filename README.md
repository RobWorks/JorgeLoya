In this git you can find 2 proyects:

Kalman filter: There are programs for simulations with real and no real data. The real data is obtained from a MPU9250(IMU) and uBlox-Neo6m (GPS). You can also find an embbeded application (FRDMK64), but is no finish yet.
Madgwick AHRS: An embbeded application to get Roll-Pitch-Yaw using Madgwick algorithm. Implemented using a FRDMK64 and AGM01 (IMU 9DOF/FXOS8700/FXAS21002C).
